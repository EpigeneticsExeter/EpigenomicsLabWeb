# Epigenomics Lab Website
This is the repository for epigenomicslab.com (eventually).

Currently the pages are being deployed to:
https://EpigeneticsExeter.github.io/EpigenomicsLabWeb/

In the future these pages will be deployed to an external provider. I'll then
make this a private repository (hopefully the deployment still works).
