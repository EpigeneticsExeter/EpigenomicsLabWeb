# Epigenomics Lab Website
This is the repository for epigenomicslab.com (eventually).

Currently the pages are being deployed to:
https://EpigeneticsExeter.github.io/EpigenomicsLabWeb/

In the future these pages will be deployed to an external provider. I'll then
make this a private repository (hopefully the deployment still works).

## Documentation

To learn how to run the site and how to contribute (*etc.*) head on over to the
[documentation](https://github.com/EpigeneticsExeter/EpigenomicsLabWeb/tree/main/documentation) 
directory of this repository.
