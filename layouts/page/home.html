    <p>Sequencing the genome was only the first step in our quest to understand how genes are expressed and
        functionally regulated. Increased understanding about the functional complexity of the genome has led to
        growing recognition about the role of epigenetic variation in the etiology of neuropsychiatric and
        neurodegenerative disease. Epigenetic processes act to dynamically control gene expression independently
        of DNA sequence variation and are known to regulate key neurobiological and cognitive processes in the
        brain. Our group takes an integrated genomics approach to understand the molecular mechanisms involved
        in brain health and disease across the life-course.</p>

        <h2>Our Main Areas of Research</h2>
        <p>Our research focuses on neurodegeneration, neurodevelopment, 
            and neuropsychiatry, as well as the epigenomic factors involved in 
            complex and rare diseases, including cancer and obesity.</p>
