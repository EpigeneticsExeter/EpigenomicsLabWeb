Alternative splicing dramatically increases transcriptomic and proteomic
diversity from the coding genome. Long-read sequencing approaches can be used
to generate full-length transcript sequences and characterise isoform
diversity. We used Oxford Nanopore transcriptome sequencing to profile
transcript diversity across human brain development and aging. We identify
changes in alternative splicing, with differential transcript usage between
human foetal and adult cortex. We show that genes associated with
neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders are characterised by
considerable RNA isoform diversity. Our data confirm the importance of
alternative splicing in the human cortex and represent an important mechanism
underpinning gene regulation in the brain.
