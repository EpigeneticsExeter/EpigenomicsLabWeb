# Genetics of DNA Methylation Consortium

## About GoDMC
GoDMC was established with the view of bringing together researchers with an
interest in studying the genetic basis of DNA methylation variation, to
consolidate as many resources and expertise as possible and thereby expedite
this field of research.

## Aims and Objectives
With this in mind the following aims and objectives have been set out:

1) To encourage collaborations for rapid large-scale replication and
meta-analyses following a conventional genome-wide association study (GWAS)
consortium structure
2) To provide an online forum to publicise potential data sources and on-going
studies
3) To generate the most comprehensive catalogue of DNA methylation quantitative
trait loci (mQTL) and to make these available as a resource to the wider
community. This includes analyses of different types of genetic variation and
statistics derived from either DNA methylation or genetic variants.
4) To enable projects that require DNA methylation and/or genetic data with
goals aligned to our own to take advantage of our consortium model.
5) To use the mQTL catalogue in causal inference approaches to identify causal
mechanisms of complex traits

## Achievements so far
To date, GoDMC comprises representatives from 50+ research groups. Together
these groups have the potential to contribute data from multiple sources
including a range of population, birth and disease specific cohorts, capturing
a range of ages and ethnic backgrounds. Details on these cohorts can be found
here.

In Phase One our objective was to generate a database of DNA methylation
quantitative trait loci (mQTL) in a large set of samples for the purpose of
understanding the genetic architecture of DNA methylation and identifying
functional effects of genetic risk factors for complex disease. This
collaborative effort resulted in a publication in Nature Genetics, and our
database has been utilised in many other follow up publications.

While completion of Phase One was a major achievement of its own, the
analytical infrastructure we developed, and consortium of cohorts attracted
interest for a number of follow on projects. Furthermore, the technologies have
moved on since our initial pipeline was developed and we believe there is now
scope to expand and update our mQTL catalogue.

Six broad project areas have been set out and a number of projects within these
areas have already been proposed. For details on how to join GoDMC and its
ongoing activities or how to propose new projects please see the Information
page.
