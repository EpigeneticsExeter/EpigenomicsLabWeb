## The summer BBQ of 2025

Yesterday, the lab swapped pipettes for paddles and PCR machines for picnic
blankets as we embarked on a much-needed retreat to the stunning Maer in
Exmouth. The sun was blazing—perfect for a BBQ, where the sizzle of burgers and
the aroma of grilled veggies filled the air (though, admittedly, Jon could not
replicate the precision of a thermal cycler when it came to cooking
temperature).

## The feast

No lab outing is complete without proper sustenance, and this BBQ did not
disappoint. The grill was a battlefield of sizzling proteins—classic beef
burgers and sausages sizzled alongside some special "synthetic flesh".

The buns, tragically uncut, became an impromptu test of manual dexterity.
Knives were wielded with varying degrees of success—Rosie’s attempt at
splitting the bun cleanly in half left something to be desired, leaving crumbs
scattered like fragmented reads in an RNA-seq dataset.

On the side, we had chilli and mozzarella, crisps, and a colorful array of
carrots and peppers with dip. And let’s not forget the pickles, whose tangy
bite cut through the richness like rs429358’s p=3.7×10⁻¹⁹ in a meta-analysis of
late-onset Alzheimer’s risk loci—undeniable, sharp, and impossible to ignore.

## The games

Frisbees soared through the air like poorly aligned reads in a FASTQ file,
while the vortex proved some of us had better hand-eye coordination than
others. Football and cricket matches broke out, revealing hidden athletic
talents among the bioinformaticians.

After some nondescript amount of time, we hit the beach, where sandcastles were
constructed with the same meticulous detail as a multiple sequence alignment. A
brave few ventured into the water for paddleboarding, their balance as
precarious as a poorly thoughtout ATAC-seq pipeline. The rest of us lounged,
soaking in the UV rays—thankfully, unlike our DNA, we remembered sunscreen to
prevent thymine dimers.
